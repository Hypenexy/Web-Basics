// You should always put all declarations at the top of each script or function for a cleaner code!
var name;
let number;
const anotherNumber = "Must be initialized apparently";

// Here's an example of how to use variables.
console.log(name);
var addition = number + anotherNumber;

// var, let and const are all used to declare variables in javascript.
// I don't think there's any difference between them. Yes there is you DUMBASS (I am referring to my past me.)

// var - a variable

// let - a variable with different, for some more normal, scopes.
// For example:
//
// if(true){
//   var cool = 1
//   let uncool = 1
// }
// console.log(cool) // Should output 1
// console.log(uncool) // Should output undefined

// const - a variable that can be defined once and cannot be changed, a constant!
