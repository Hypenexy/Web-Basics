//You should always put all declarations at the top of each script or function for a cleaner code!
var name;
let number;
const anotherNumber;

//Here's an example of how to use variables.
console.log(name);
var addition = number + anotherNumber;

//var, let and const are all used to declare variables in javascript.
//I don't think there's any difference between them.
